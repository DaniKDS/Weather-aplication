# **Weather-aplication**

## Requirements implemented
- The application is functional and runs on local host.
- The application is connected to a WeatherApi(openweathermap), and the initial data are of the current location.
- The application is responsive for both desktop and mobile.
- Semantic use of Web elements.
- The forecast appears in the graphic interface. 

### Images with the application

- In the first picture is the user's first interaction with the interface, which will open automatically with the weather data from his location.

- In the last picture I displayed an error message, in case we were looking for a city/area that does not exist.The browser will refresh after searching for a city and receiving an error message.
